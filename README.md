# apigee-demo
These are some downloaded Apigee gateways used for a blog post. Link to post: (will update one published)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

To get started with Apigee Edge, see the Apigee docs [here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/get-started/get-started). You can then upload these via the Apigee Dashboard: API Gateways > + Proxy > create some dummy proxy. Then in the Proxy Overview view, click Project > upload new revision, and pick one of the directories here. 

### Prerequisites

* A demo account for Apigee Edge - see the Apigee docs [here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/get-started/get-started)
* Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/anthonyvetter/apigee-demo.git`

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Upload these demo gateways to your Apigee Edge account. Starting at the Apigee Edge Dashboard:
1. API Gateways > + Proxy
2. Create a dummy proxy
3. From the Proxy Overview tab:
4. click Project > upload new revision
5. Pick one of the directories here to upload

In the end, your gateway should function in the same way as the gateways in the demo blog post

## Running the tests

This will depend on which gateway you choose to upload, but basically:
1. Click on the Trace tab
2. Run a trace and make sure the gateway functions as expected

## Built With

* [Apigee Edge](https://apigee.com/edge) - An API gateway and management platform from Google


## Contributing

This is just a repo to hold demo gatewats for a blog post so I don't expect contibutions. But if you want to, just submit a pull request with additional downloaded Apigee gateways.
